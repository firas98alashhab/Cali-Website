							is a cryptocurrency consensus mechanism for processing transactions and creating new blocks in a blockchain. A consensus mechanism is a method for validating entries into a distributed database and keeping the database secure. In the case of cryptocurrency, the database is called a blockchain—so the consensus mechanism secures the blockchain.
						</p>
						<p class="btnnn long_p">
							With proof-of-stake (POS), cryptocurrency owners validate block transactions based on the number of staked coins.
							While PoW mechanisms require miners to solve cryptographic puzzles, PoS mechanisms require validators to hold and stake tokens for the privilege of earning transaction fees.
						</p>
						<p class="btnnn long_p">
							Proof-of-stake (POS) is seen as less risky regarding the potential for an attack on the network, as it structures compensation in a way that makes an attack less advantageous.

							The next block writer on the blockchain is selected at random, with higher odds being assigned to nodes with larger stake positions.

							In a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain, the chain is secured by miners performing randomized calculations in parallel in a race to come up with the correct answer. These calculations, while useful for securing the chain, serve no real-world purpose and are often a target for criticism of blockchain technology as the power consumption required to perform this proof of work can be extensive. Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) is the solution to this. It is an alternative approach that aims to replace excessive usage of hash functions with tasks that bring additional real-world benefit, e.g. supporting scientific experiments that rely on computationally heavy simulations.
