						<p>Human robots can answer your customer's queries and provide the most up-to-date product and promotional information, increasing the likelihood that your consumers will learn, comprehend, and purchase. By tackling typical, repetitive activities, a human robot may help your staff be even more productive, freeing up their time and talent. Over the course of discussions, a human robot collects data about people's likes, personalities, preferences, and routines to tailor replies and better meet their requirements.

							is a cryptocurrency consensus mechanism for processing transactions and creating new blocks in a blockchain. A consensus mechanism is a method for validating entries into a distributed database and keeping the database secure. In the case of cryptocurrency, the database is called a blockchain—so the consensus mechanism secures the blockchain.
						</p>
						<p class="long_p">
							With proof-of-stake (POS), cryptocurrency owners validate block transactions based on the number of staked coins.
							While PoW mechanisms require miners to solve cryptographic puzzles, PoS mechanisms require validators to hold and stake tokens for the privilege of earning transaction fees.
						</p>
						<p class="long_p">
							Proof-of-stake (POS) is seen as less risky regarding the potential for an attack on the network, as it structures compensation in a way that makes an attack less advantageous.
						</p>
						<p class="long_p">
							The next block writer on the blockchain is selected at random, with higher odds being assigned to nodes with larger stake positions.

							Proof of work describes a system that requires a not-insignificant but feasible amount of effort in order to deter frivolous or malicious uses of computing power, such as sending spam emails or launching denial of service attacks.

						<p class="long_p">
							Proof of work (PoW) is a decentralized consensus mechanism that requires members of a network to expend effort solving an arbitrary mathematical puzzle to prevent anybody from gaming the system.
							Proof of work is used widely in cryptocurrency mining, for validating transactions and mining new tokens.

						<p class="long_p">
							Due to proof of work, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions can be processed peer-to-peer in a secure manner without the need for a trusted third party.

						<p>
							In a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain, the chain is secured by miners performing randomized calculations in parallel in a race to come up with the correct answer. These calculations, while useful for securing the chain, serve no real-world purpose and are often a target for criticism of blockchain technology as the power consumption required to perform this proof of work can be extensive. Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) is the solution to this. It is an alternative approach that aims to replace excessive usage of hash functions with tasks that bring additional real-world benefit, e.g. supporting scientific experiments that rely on computationally heavy simulations.
